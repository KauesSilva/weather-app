## üìï Why/How it was built

The idea for this project came from a channel on YouTube called [CodingNepal](https://youtu.be/c1r-NqYkFPc) that built a weather app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this period, I was stagnant in learning JavaScript frameworks due to my lack of knowledge in Object Oriented Programming and advanced JavaScript. 

Therefore, after that video, I decided to study all I was capable of in 2 weeks, from fundamentals to OOP, and use the max amount of this acquired knowledge in one project.

In the end, I learned: Arrow Functions, API Consumption, OOP, Async/Await Functions, Variable Scope, Map/Filter/Reduce, Array Manipulation, and so on. Many of them weren't used, but I believe it was an important step in my career, and I feel that I was able to deliver what I set out to do.
